# Open Questions

Ambiguities found during the port, each with evidence, ranked hypotheses, and the
symbol behind which the answer is isolated. Resolved items move to the bottom with
their resolution.

Format: **OQ-N** — question / evidence / hypotheses (ranked) / isolation / status.

## OQ-1: ttsim BAR sizing for the QEMU glue device

**Question:** ttsim does not implement config-space writes, so the standard
write-ones-and-read-back BAR sizing protocol cannot be used against it. What BAR
sizes must the QEMU glue advertise to the guest?

**Evidence:** `ttsim/docs/libttsim_api.md` ("config-space writes are not currently
implemented and calling it is a fatal error"); BAR base registers are readable.

**Hypotheses (ranked):**
1. Use the Blackhole BAR sizes from tt-kmd's analysis (BAR0/BAR2/BAR4 sizes are
   compile-time constants in `tt-kmd/blackhole.c`) — the guest driver only needs
   sizes consistent with what tt-kmd expects. **(adopted, pending analysis values)**
2. Derive sizes from spacing between consecutive ttsim BAR bases — fragile, rejected.

**Isolation:** `TTSIM_GLUE_BAR_SIZES[]` table in `test/qemu-ttsim/ttsim-dev.c`.

**Status:** Open; resolve when `linux-driver-analysis.md` lands the Blackhole BAR
table.

## OQ-2: Default ACL for the device interface

**Question:** Linux exposes `/dev/tenstorrent/N` as mode 0666
(`tt-kmd/udev-50-tenstorrent.rules`). Should the Windows device object allow
world-writable access by default?

**Evidence:** udev rule in upstream; Windows convention is more restrictive defaults.

**Hypotheses (ranked):**
1. Default Windows ACL (Administrators + SYSTEM full, interactive users read/write via
   `D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GRGW;;;IU)`), documented delta from Linux. **(adopted)**
2. World-accessible to mirror 0666 — rejected: violates Windows least-privilege norms
   and the spec's security constraint; tooling runs as interactive user anyway.

**Isolation:** `TTKMD_DEVICE_SDDL` in `src/driver/device.c` (single SDDL string).

**Status:** Adopted hypothesis 1; revisit if tt-umd-on-Windows needs service-context
access.

## OQ-3: M0 load test runs in the VM, not on the host

**Question:** M0 acceptance requires the empty driver to install/start against a
soft device. Doing this on the development host requires enabling test signing
(`bcdedit /set testsigning on`) — a persistent, security-relevant host change.

**Decision:** All driver installation happens in the QEMU/KVM Windows 11 guest
(see `test/README.md`). The host is never put into test-signing mode. If VM bring-up fails
irrecoverably, enabling test signing on the host is an explicit user decision, never
a default.

**Status:** Adopted; test rig is task #8.
